         XSPIF :  A cross (X) Standard PlugIn Framework

Developed by Vincent Goudard and Remy Muller at IRCAM

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is XSPIF ?
---------------------

XSPIF is an environment allowing you to develop audio plugins through a unique XML specification, which can be parsed to generate automatically the 
C/C++ source files of various plugins standards such as VST, LADSPA, AudioUnits, MAX/MSP.
This environment offers you the following advantages:
1. Implement your plugin once, export in many standards. 
2. Reducing the time needed to develop a plugin by writing only the code
necessary for your plugin behaviour.


The development steps:
1. Implement the XML file.
2. Launch the python script with the following command:

	python  xspif2DesiredStandard  myPlugin.xml

    to generate the plugin C/C++ source files in the 'DesiredStandard'
3. Compile your plugin C/C++ source files.
